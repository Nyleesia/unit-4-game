# unit-4-game
GA Tech web development fourth assignment

<p>Woah!!! </p>
<p>This was a bit tougher than I expected it to be.</p>
<p>However, this was as fun as all the previous assignments. 
I enjoyed breaking my code and fixing it, over and over again, because, everytime I did that, I learned something new!
I just hope right now that I can enjoy the forth of July weekend and that someone can enjoy my game :). </p>
<p> Live long and prosper. </p>
<p>From Yoshi and I, </p>
<p>Happy Independence!!!!!</p>
